# Phishing Website Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a phishing website detection project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to classify websites as either legitimate or phishing based on website features extracted using CNNs.

## Project Overview

Phishing websites are malicious sites designed to steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Detecting and blocking these websites is crucial for maintaining online security. In this project, we leverage CNNs, known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks, to classify websites as legitimate or phishing based on visual features extracted from website screenshots.
